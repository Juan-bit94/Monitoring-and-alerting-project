# Monitoring-and-alerting-project
This project is to setup monitoring and alerting on Linux Ubuntu 
# What is monitoring and alerting in IT?
This is a critical aspect of infrastructure and application management. It helps professionals identify issues, track performance, and ensure the availability and reliability of systems. 
# How to conduct monitoring and alerting in an IT environment
## 1. Define Monitoring goals and objectives
- Establish clear goals of monitoring efforts.
- Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics to monitor.
## 2. Select monitoring tools
- There are various commercial and open-source monitoring solutions available such as Nagios, Zabbix, and Prometheus to name a few. 
## 3. Identify what to monitor
- Determin componenets, services, and systems that needs monitoring such as servers, network devices, and databases to name a few. 
## 4. Set up monitoring metrics
- Configure monitoring tools to collect and store relevant metrics.
- This could include server CPU, memory usage, network bandwidth, and ect. 
## 5. Define thresholds and baselines
- By establishing this will enable the use of alerts.
- When metrics breach these thresholds it will alert the user.
- Can be dynamic thresholds based on histrocial data or baselines to reduce false alarms. 
## 6. Alerting rules
- These rules will determine what actions to take when a metric exceeds a threshold.
- Includes sending email notifications, SMS alerts, or trigger automated responses. 
## 7. Notification channels
- Notification channels for alerts such as email, SMS, messaging apps, or integrating with incident management systems (PagerDuty or OpsGenie)
## 8. Escalation policies
- Define escalation policies to ensure that alerts are addessed promptly.
## 9. Dashboard creation
- Create real-time dashboards to visualize metrics and rpovide a holistic view of the health and performance of systems.
- Toold like Grafana and Kibana are popular for this. 
## 10. Documentation
- Maintain documentation that includes information about what is being monitored, how alerts are configured, and how to respond to different types of alerts. 
## 11. Testing and tuning
- Regularly test monitoring setup, adjust thresholds, and rules as needed to minimize false positives. 
## 12. Incident response plan
- Develop a clear incident response plan that outlines the steps to take when an alert is triggered, including roles and responsibilities for different team members.
